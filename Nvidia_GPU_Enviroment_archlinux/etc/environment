#According to Nvidia, the cause of this constant re-generation is that most recent drivers produce relatively large shader caches, and given that the default space limit/threshold in the driver is small, then the driver itself will try to delete the cache of same/other games to make room - thus forcing cache recreation each time.

#It has been suggested that setting the following flags in your profile (i.e. inside the file ~/.profile or similar) may help with the bloated shader cache that most recent Nvidia drivers seem to produce.

# Enable shader disk cache per game instead of regenerating the cache at every
# game launch. The disk cache path should no longer be required, however if
# the shader cache is being regenerated each launch, try specifying it.
