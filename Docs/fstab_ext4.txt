example:
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /  ext4  defaults,noatime,discard,commit=60  0  1

Option          Effect
noatime         Disables recording file access times, reducing write operations (improves SSD lifespan & performance).
discard	        Enables TRIM support, helping the SSD maintain performance by garbage-collecting unused blocks.
commit=60       Reduces journal sync frequency to every 60 seconds (improves performance at a slight risk of data loss on crash).

Additional Optimizations (Optional):
data=writeback (faster but slightly less safe)
errors=remount-ro (prevents corruption by remounting read-only on errors)

Notes:
TRIM Alternatives: If discard causes slowdowns, use weekly fstrim instead:

sh
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer --now
