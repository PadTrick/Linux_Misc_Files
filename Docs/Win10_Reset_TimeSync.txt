If you Dual Boot Windows and Linux (like me), you maybe notice that the Time doesnt sync correctly
if you change from one OS the the other. Under Archlinux its just one click to activate the
timesync and it works correctly. However, Windows is "special" in that regard, it doesnt Sync at
all, even if its activated. I always have to untick and retick the option for TimeSync to correctly
set the Time. This info below will automate this process. After a few seconds in windows,
it will set the time correctly.
Set the User/Group to SYSTEM.
create a batch file and put it into where every you like(for i its C:\reset_timesync.bat)
write these 4 lines in it:

w32tm /debug /disable
w32tm /unregister
w32tm /register
net start w32time

save and close it.
after that, open scheduler (aufgabenplanung in german) and add a new event (not a basic event).
At the tab General, give whatever you want as name and select the box "Run with highest privileges"
and at the bottom at Configure for: select "Windows 10".
Set the User to SYSTEM or Admin.
At the tab Triggers, create a new trigger and at Begin the task: select "At log on" or "At startup".
At the tab Conditions, untick all.
At the tab Actions, create a new action, at Action: select "Start a program" and browser for the
batch file you created earlier.
After that, just hit "OK" to save everything.

now the timesync should reset at every reboot.
