Tested Steam Version of Read Dead Redemption 2.
Rockstar Launcher with wine-wayland renders black. --in-process-gpu doesnt help.
On first launch i had to use xwayland to press all the buttons and load the game 1 time.
After that i was able to enable wine-wayland, which resulted in the launcher rendered black.
But since i dont have to press any buttons and just wait, it launched the game.
