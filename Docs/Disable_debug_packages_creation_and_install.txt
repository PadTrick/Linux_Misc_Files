Here are the lines you need to adjust in your makepkg.conf to prevent the creation of debug packages:

/etc/makepkg.conf
1. DEBUG_CFLAGS and DEBUG_CXXFLAGS

These flags set debugging options, which you can disable. Comment out these two lines to remove the debugging flags:

#DEBUG_CFLAGS="-g"
#DEBUG_CXXFLAGS="$DEBUG_CFLAGS"

2. OPTIONS

In the OPTIONS line, there is the debug option, which activates debugging by default. You should disable debug by placing a ! in front of it:

OPTIONS=(strip docs !libtool !staticlibs emptydirs zipman purge !debug lto)

The !debug ensures that no debug information is added.
Summary of changes:

#DEBUG_CFLAGS="-g"
#DEBUG_CXXFLAGS="$DEBUG_CFLAGS"
OPTIONS=(strip docs !libtool !staticlibs emptydirs zipman purge !debug lto)

With these changes, no debug packages should be created.
