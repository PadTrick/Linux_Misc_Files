Install Windows 10
Shrink the Windows Partition
Boot up Archlinux Iso
Enter >>lsblk<< to list Disks
>>cfdisk /dev/YOURDEVICE<< (for me >>cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1<<)
Create at least 1x Partition of ~600M Type EFI Filesystem and 1x Partition for the actual Archlinux installation.
Format those partitions (those commands are for my own disks, change to your needs)
>>mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p5<<
>>mkfs.btrfs /dev/nvme0n1p6<<
after this, start >>archinstall<<
all you need to make sure, is that you setup the mount points during Disk Setup.
your efi partition should be >>/boot<<
your archlinux partition should be >>/<<

After installation, select YES to change the installation, we need to copy some win10 files.
list your disks with >>lsblk<<
create a mountpoint
>>mkdir /mnt/win10>>
>>mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/win10<< (change the to your disks)
go into your mountpoint
>>cd /mnt/win10<<
>>cd EFI<<
>>ls<<
copy the Microsoft folder into your /boot
>>cp -r /mnt/win10/EFI/Microsoft /boot/EFI<<

Now you can Exit & Reboot
>>exit<<
>>reboot<<
